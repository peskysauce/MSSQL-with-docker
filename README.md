### **Case**

My third project serve as a practice to familiarise with data further with SQL server.

The primary goal of this project is to further practice my intermedaite SQL skills such as window functions, aggregations, subqueries, CTE's, JOINS, table constraints etc.

JOINS will be the main focus and I have searched for a dataset with multiple tables, assigned with primary and foreign keys to perform relational manipulation. Another focus of this project is datetime manipulation and understanding SLQ Server's function on datetime parsing and extraction.

There are also some descriptive statistics aggregation for simple and swift understanding of our dataset.

With the above considerations - especially on JOINS - I've managed to source an e-commerce dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) with 9 tables in total, 6 out of the 9 tables will be of focus as the remaining three does not convey any important information. 

The query is attached in this repository and written in SQL server, if you're running on a different platform some minor tweaks will be necessary.
